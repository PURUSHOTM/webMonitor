# Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive rate limiting system to prevent abuse of the API, especially by free users. Here's what was added:

### 1. Database Schema
- Added a new `rate_limits` table to persist rate limit data across server restarts
- Updated the database initialization script to create this table with appropriate indexes

### 2. Rate Limiting Service
- Created a new service (`server/services/rate-limit.ts`) with:
  - In-memory caching for performance
  - Database persistence for reliability
  - Tier-based limiting (free vs paid users)
  - Category-based limits (general, frequent, intensive, critical)
  - Proper HTTP response headers
  - Graceful failure handling (fail open)

### 3. Rate Limit Categories
- **General**: Standard operations (100/1000 requests per 15 min)
- **Frequent**: High-frequency reads (200/2000 requests per 15 min)
- **Intensive**: Resource-intensive operations (50/500 requests per 15 min)
- **Critical**: External communications (10/50 requests per 15 min)

### 4. Applied to All API Endpoints
- Added rate limiting to all authenticated API routes in `server/routes.ts`
- Categorized endpoints appropriately based on their operation type
- Maintained existing functionality while adding protection

### 5. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation explaining the implementation
- Documented usage patterns and response formats

## How It Works

1. When a user makes an authenticated request to a rate-limited endpoint:
   - The middleware checks if the user has exceeded their limits
   - It first checks an in-memory cache for performance
   - If not in cache, it checks the database
   - If limits are exceeded, it returns a 429 error
   - Otherwise, it updates the counter and allows the request

2. Rate limits automatically reset after the specified window (15 minutes)

3. Response headers provide clients with current limit information:
   - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
   - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
   - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When the limit window resets

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement actual user tier detection based on subscription status
2. Add global rate limits for additional protection
3. Add IP-based rate limiting for unauthenticated endpoints
4. Create a rate limit analytics dashboard
